        <h1>Food Generator</h1>
        <p id="aboutProgramm">Imagine that you have some products in your fridge and you don't know what to cook with
            them.
            If you often turn out yourself in a similar situation, then you have come to the right place. With this dish
            generator,
            you can select products which you have and we will generate dishes that could be prepared with them.
            Also we will give you the opportunity to cook something else, if you add a few ingredients.
            In our ingredient-list you will not find products such as salt and spices, because in our opinion it is
            an individual choice of everyone
            (except a few dishes where they are mandatory). Here you choose only the main ingredients, and then you can
            add any spices you prefer.
            At the moment the generator has 90+ ingredients and 70+ dishes. And the most important thing, if you are
            going
            to fry something, don't forget to buy oil :)
